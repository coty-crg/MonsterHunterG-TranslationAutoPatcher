# What is this?!
This is a language patcher for Monter Hunter G (PS2)! The tool dumps the ISO to disk, unpacks the archive files, decompresses those files, patches them, recompresses those files, repacks the archive files, then rebuilds a bootable ISO! 


### Requirements: 
  - Python: https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2717/ 
  - Imgburn: http://download.imgburn.com/SetupImgBurn_2.5.8.0.exe
  - PatchFile: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vExiik0_Gz9Gm0joQypoTBMqZHPsyQZXINSTQmz-xOs/

To get the patchfile, navigate to the Google Doc (PatchFile tab) -> File -> Download -> As Comma Separated Values (.csv, current sheet). 
The patcher comes with one, but it's probably already out of date, so I highly recommend downloading another .csv from the Google Doc.
